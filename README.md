## Adaptive Framework Concept

The Adaptive framework contains all the logic related "UX presentation" & "data aggregation".

Several functionality must be implemented:
- Authentication & Authorization
- Product presentation & Recommendation (aka Customer Journey).
- Payment Management.
All these functionalities represents the "mandatory features" of every marketplace scenario.

During this "EUvsVirus Hackathon" we mainly focus on the innovative part of solution an we prepare:
- A "draft" version of the solution architecture (innovative technologies stack).
- A PoC (proof of concept) of the "search functionality" based on an innovative approach (proximity related).
